Welcome to Night Owls
=========================

This is a build-up for the FCC Dynamic Web App challenge: Build a nightlife coordination app<br>

Users can see which places are RSVP'd and how many. Authenticated users (via Twitter) are able to RSVP ahead of time with a single click to join and another to cancel. Authenticated users sessions are saved so when you login, the last location you were viewing will be restored.
