Welcome to Night Owls
=========================

Nightlife coordination app<br>

Users can see which places are RSVP'd and how many. Authenticated users (via Twitter) are able to RSVP ahead of time with a single click to join and another to cancel. Authenticated users sessions are saved so when you login, the last location you were viewing will be restored.<br>

To see a small demo enter zip code 33458 in the search bar. In the fully functioning app all RSVP's are cleared at the end of the night.

Searching with an empty input value will call the browsers geo location feature.
